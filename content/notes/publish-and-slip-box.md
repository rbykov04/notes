*First*, I will try to formulate the problem.

I have a really big network of notes.
For example, I used to use a slip-box just to make notes in classes.
I put a lot of effort into building my network and it will serve no purpose.
There are so many notes in my slip-box and I want to reuse them.

It seems I found a solution.
The solution is publishing.
Why is this a solution?
I have a purpose: to share notes.

Why can't I just share notes as is?
I can't share notes with anyone because of their quality.
And before there weren't the reasons to improve them.
Moreover, improvement of notes is time-consuming. And it used to stop me from improving notes.
If I start publishing notes I will rework notes and improve them.

*Conclusion*: A solution is publishing. The simple is that.
Thanks for your attention.
